# GuiAPI-Redone

This API speeds up and improves the process of creating GUIs for Minecraft plugins.

It is designed with customizeability and expandability in mind, if you don't like the preexisting Windows, you can easily expand upon them or make your own.

# No more major updates

Will update pom to newer Minecraft version if requested but won't fix Major issues that arise with them (such as TextWindow being broken with 1.21.3 now)

Will fix smaller bugs if issues opened

## Dependencies

Depends on [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) if the [TextWindow](https://skiftstar.github.io/GuiAPI-Redone/Kyu/GuiAPI_Redone/Window/WindowImpl/TextWindow/TextWindow.html) is used
